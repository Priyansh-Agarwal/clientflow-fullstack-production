## üß™ Example Usage

### **Complete Appointment Lifecycle:**

1. **Create Appointment**
```javascript
const createResponse = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customer_name: 'John Doe',
    customer_phone: '+1234567890',
    service_name: 'Haircut',
    scheduled_at: '2024-01-15T10:00:00Z',
    duration: 60,
    total_price: 50.00
  })
});

const appointment = await createResponse.json();
console.log('Created:', appointment.data);
```

2. **Update Status to Confirmed**
```javascript
const statusResponse = await fetch(`/api/appointments/${appointmentId}/status`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'confirmed'
  })
});
// This triggers SMS confirmation notification
```

3. **Reschedule Appointment**
```javascript
const rescheduleResponse = await fetch(`/api/appointments/${appointmentId}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    scheduled_at: '2024-01-15T14:00:00Z'
  })
});
// This triggers SMS reschedule notification
```

4. **Cancel Appointment**
```javascript
const cancelResponse = await fetch(`/api/appointments/${appointmentId}/status`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'cancelled',
    cancellation_reason: 'Customer request'
  })
});
// This triggers SMS cancellation notification
```

### **Advanced Filtering Examples:**

```javascript
// Get today's confirmed appointments
const todayStart = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0] + 'T00:00:00Z';
const todayEnd = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0] + 'T23:59:59Z';

const filtered = await fetch(`/api/appointments?start_date=${todayStart}&end_date=${todayEnd}&status=confirmed`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token' }
});

// Search for appointments by customer name
const searchQuery = 'John';
const searchResults = await fetch(`/api/appointments?customer_search=${searchQuery}`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token' }
});

// Get cancelled appointments with reasons
const cancelled = await fetch('/api/appointments?status=cancelled&include_cancelled=true', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer your-jwt-token' }
});
```

## üîß Business Logic

### **Appointment Status Flow:**
```
pending ‚Üí [confirmed, cancelled]
confirmed ‚Üí [completed, cancelled] 
completed ‚Üí (final state)
cancelled ‚Üí [confirmed] (rebooking)
no_show ‚Üí (final state)
```

### **Automatic Calculations:**
- **End Time**: `scheduled_at + duration`
- **Status Updates**: Automatic field updates based on status
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping appointments
- **SMS Triggers**: Based on status changes and schedule updates

### **Data Relationships:**
- **Customer Link**: Links to customers table via `customer_id`
- **Business Isolation**: All appointments filtered by `business_id`
- **Service Catalog**: Links to services table via `service_id`
